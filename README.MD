URL Homewood 
testing


Please test both of these temporary test links:

When you click either one, you will get a splash page for the website in beginning test mode. This is NOT final website. The final URL will be much simpler.

Please click on this from your phone. Write down the following:

1:) Phone you are using: iPhone, Android or other.
2:) width and height numbers you see on screen.
3:) Rotate the phone sideways. Press the button on the page.
4:) write down width snd height numbers you see on screen.

Next, do the same thing from your computer. Need width and height numbers. And, of course, do not need to rotate the monitor :)

Please let me know what browser you are using: 
Internet Explorer?
Edge?
Chrome?
Firefox?
Safari?

Please text or email me with your results.
